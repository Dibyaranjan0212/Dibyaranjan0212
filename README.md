### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a B.Tech CSE student with a passion for becoming a data engineer. Here's a bit about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects that involve data processing, storage, and analysis using Python, NumPy, Pandas, and SQL. I'm also developing web applications using Flask for data visualization and interaction.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about data pipelines, and cloud platforms like AWS (Amazon Web Services) to expand my skill set in data engineering.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to data engineering, data pipelines, and distributed computing to gain practical experience and contribute to real-world solutions.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to Python programming, data analysis, SQL databases, or Flask web development. I'm always eager to share knowledge and learn from others.
